                    <p className='text-[22px] font-normal mb-[30px]'>At TYTW, our core belief is that every girl should be free to determine the course of her own life. We envision a world where adolescent girls are free to be children and teens with access to all levels of education and healthcare. Every day TYTW is committed to the fight for bodily autonomy, which includes reproductive rights, access to sexual and reproductive health resources, and access to safe abortion services.</p>
                    <p className='text-[22px] font-normal mb-[30px]'>In this time of alarming rollbacks of rights for women and girls, TYTW is launching its Girls Choice Initiative, which provides support for girls under the age of 18 in need of abortion services in the US. Through the program, TYTW engages in advocacy and grantmaking to organizations providing financial, logistical, and psychosocial support to girls seeking abortion care.</p>

                        <p className='text-[22px] font-normal mb-[30px]'>TYTW's virtual U.S.-based program launched in Fall 2020 in acknowledgement of the myriad complexities - and opportunities - faced by girls in these times. Resilient Girls is meant to help inspire girls globally to imagine, inspire and build a better world, together, and to support each other as we strive to make these dreams our reality. This virtual advocacy and empowerment program facilitates conversation between female youth leaders worldwide, spotlighting crucial issues as they exchange stories of strength, survival, and perseverance. Each Resilient Girls story features an interview facilitated by an American girl, with a diverse roster of interview subjects ranging from survivors of trauma, youth leaders, and pioneering professionals, highlighting stories of hope and resilience. TYTW thanks program partner <a href="/p">NewEra Creative</a>  <a href="/p">Space</a>, sponsor <a href="/p">Canon USA</a> and strategic advisement partner <a href="/p">Fenton</a> for their integral roles in producing Resilient Girls.

While developing cross-cultural communication skills and expanding their global knowledge, student participants help raise awareness on the issue of child marriage and of successful campaigns by girls, their families and communities who have halted the practice.</p>
